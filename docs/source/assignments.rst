Assignments
===========

Assignments for the first part of the course. The group project instructions
to be added elsewhere.

.. warning::
	All assignments are returned through
	`Moodle <https://moodle.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=26691>`_
 	(course key: cc2017). Do **not** send them by email!

**Preliminaries:**

	#. Set the development environment (see :doc:`setup`)

		- Install Python 3.5
		- Create a virtual environment
		- Install ``requirements.txt``

	#. Get used to Python (see :doc:`learn_python`). Things to consider
	   include:

		- Basic syntax: loops, lists, dictionaries, ``def``, ``class``,
		  ``import``, etc.
		- What does ``__init__``-function do for the classes? (see, e.g.
		  `Data Model <https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names>`_)
		- How to run Python programs from the command line?

    Each week there is an article to be read, and the students write a short essay
    (**max** 250 words) summarizing its main points. The deadlines to the essays
    are on Tuesdays at 23.55. Include your UH user name and student number to the
    pdf!

    .. note::
        Exception: First week's essay deadline is on Thursday 3.11. at 23.55!

           **Read**: The first ~16 pages (until the section: Application of the SPECS
           Methodology to an Evaluative Case Study), you can also skip the Survey-part
           from the background section if you so wish. The article is somewhat longer
           than in the previous weeks, but it is easy to read. (due Tue 22.11. 23.55)

Exercises
---------

Weekly programming and theoretical exercise deadlines are on Sundays at 23.55
every week. The exercises marked with **RETURN** at the start,
will be the ones that accumulate your course points in Part 1.

Exercises that are marked as *(Code)* should be included into one compressed
file at each week (see below). Exercises that are marked as *(Text)* have
a separate Moodle assignment for them.

**Weekly Exercises:**

    #. :doc:`ex_mc_parsing`
    #. :doc:`ex_metaphor`
    #. :doc:`ex_fact_generation`
	#. :doc:`ex_poem`

..
	#. :doc:`ex_mc_mas`
	#. :doc:`ex_mas_memory`

Remember to return the exercises through Moodle. The coding exercises should be in
one compressed file which extracts to a folder with your UH user name. That is,
if your user name in UH is ``cthulhu`` and you return a file ``cthulhu_w1.tar.gz``, then
it should extract, for example, to the following structure::

	cthulhu/
		ex1.py
		ex2.py
		README # General info if needed
		some_file.txt
